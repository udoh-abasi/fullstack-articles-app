      `Education can be considered as one of the best weapons that a person should have to succeed in life.  Education in very important in any society it can be seen as a major a pillar or building stone in a society, its is a wonder how the workers of the “major pillar” in a society can be so unrecognized.`,
      `I met some of my teachers in high school, I met Mrs Ajayi my math teacher who taught me how to how to think analytically and have better reasoning abilities. I met my English teacher, Mr John who taught me how to enhance creativity and mental flexibility.`,
      `I met Mrs Moses my accounting teacher who taught me how to make investment decision and how to improve productivity.`,
      `I remember all their kindness and encouragement, I remember how their work changed me from being a girl that sees nothing good in the future, a girl who rather spend all her time playing into an avid reader who loved “beating” the math problems put in front of me.`,
      `Teachers are the foundations of societies because their trade is the lifeblood for humanity. Education shapes minds, lives, communities, and the world.`,
      `Then why are they underpaid? They are underpaid because education is undervalued. The society would rather spend billions of dollar to pay basketball players, footballers why because they valve this more.`,
      `It is amazing how we justify the incomes of teachers. It’s as if the traditionally low income for teachers has become normalized on a societal level.`,
      `We live in a society that simply places a low priority on the care and treatment of children unless profits are involved.`,
      `We can do better! everyday we loss teachers “building blocks” to other professions. Who then would build our society?`,

    title: "Gender Inequality",
    content: [
      `Gender inequality is discrimination based on sex or gender causing one sex or gender to be routinely privileged or prioritized over another. Gender inequality is the social phenomenon in which people are not treated equally based on gender. The treatment may arise from distinctions regarding biology, psychology, or cultural norms prevalent in the society.`,
      `One of the major causes of gender inequality is the lack of awareness among women about their rights and their ability to achieve equality. This lack of awareness is often due to the prevailing cultural and social norms, which dictate that women should be subservient to men. Child marriage is one the most devastating examples of gender inequality, as it limits women's opportunities and their ability to reach their full individual potential. Human Trafficking: Adult women and girls account for 71 percent of all human trafficking victims detected globally.`,
      `Women are not to be objectified, we have women who are talented, endowed with great vision and talent but are not given the opportunity to use this gift imagine great women like;`,
      `Maya Angelou who was an American memoirist, popular poet, and civil rights activist`,
      `Jane Austen who is known for her six completed novels, among them the highly adapted Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.`,
      `Mary Slessor was a Scottish missionary that stopped the killing of twins in Nigeria, and so many others `,
      `If these women where not given the opportunity to use their talent and gift they would not have made their mark on history and we would not be celebrating them today.`,
      `Unequal societies are less cohesive. They have higher rates of anti-social behaviors and violence. Countries with greater gender equality are more connected. Their people are healthier and have better wellbeing. Let us be an advocate of gender equality in our family, workplace and society.`,
